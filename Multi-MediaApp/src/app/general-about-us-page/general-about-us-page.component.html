          This webpage provides users with the ability to search for games and
          save game information such as name and description. Users can organize
          their gaming experience by adding games to two separate lists: one for
          currently playing games and another for finished games. This
          feature-rich platform helps users track their gaming progress and
          easily manage their gaming library.

        <h3>Haki Martin</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Haki. I have been illustrating, creating comics and
          stories, and developing video games my whole life. I love the creative
          side of the human experience, and so I made a photo gallery. I want
          people to share their favorite pieces of art, whether it be a movie
          poster, a photograph, a character design, or anything they want. As
          they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.

          Users will be able to upload an image URL to our database. The app
          will display all images in the database in a horizontally-scrolling
          section of the window. If the image was uploaded by that user, they
          will see an option to delete or update the image. The gallery will
          scroll infinitely until all images are loaded.
